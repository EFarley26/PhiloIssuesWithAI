              AI systems are always online and always accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This makes them a
              24/7 source of knowledge with a split-second response time that simply isn’t possible by traditional teachers.
              Students now have a resource to ask questions and fully explore to their hearts content anytime they want to 
              learn more. Complex topics can be explored instantly and re-explained countless times with the ability to
              ask continuous follow-up questions. Through AI, students’ ability to learn and develop their minds can finally
              keep up with their curiosity.

              One of the biggest perks of embedding AI into education is AI’s ability to learn and adapt to the users’ learning
              style over time. Through AI, this can be done on an individual level, giving each student a dedicated resource
              tailored to their learning needs. At the blink of an eye, AI can switch from producing text, to generating images,
              to creating podcasts as new ways to teach content. As AI changes its style based on student feedback and success,
              it can reteach difficult concepts in new ways designed to help students thrive on a student-by-student basis.

              argues in <em>AI and the Philosophy of Education</em>, AI represents a shift toward a more interactive and dialogic
              educational experience, where learning becomes a dynamic exchange rather than a strictly instructor-driven
              process. This assistance is magnified for students with disabilities, where AI can help bring out their best work.

              From a teaching perspective, AI tools offer the chance for teachers to focus more on students and their needs
              and less on the administrative side of the classroom. Assignment creation, editing slideshows, and even grading
              to a degree can be supported by AI, dramatically reducing the burden on teachers. This extra time can then be
              spent with students, especially those who benefit most from individual attention. In this way, AI serves as a
              support tool rather than a replacement for educators. This aligns with
              <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/1289f04d-de3b-4a1d-9b94-f6962608a4dd/content"

              </a>
              claim that as AI takes over administrative tasks, teachers are freed to focus on the social, ethical, and
              mentorship aspects of education where human judgment remains irreplaceable. This is particularly relevant in
              K–12 classrooms, where overcrowding often leaves teachers exhausted and students overlooked. Teachers can spend
              less time behind their desk and more time in front of real students solving real problems.
