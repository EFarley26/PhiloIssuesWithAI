                Intelligent tutoring systems can provide 24/7 support, ensuring that students have access to help whenever they need it, 
                not just during office hours or class time. This is particularly valuable for students in remote areas or those who may 
                feel uncomfortable asking questions in traditional classroom settings.

                Rather than replacing human intelligence, AI can augment human thinking by handling computational tasks, data analysis, 
                and pattern recognition, allowing students to focus on conceptual understanding, creativity, and critical reasoning.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI tools can serve as collaborative partners in problem-solving, helping students explore complex scenarios, test hypotheses, 
                and visualize abstract concepts. This partnership model prepares students for future workplaces where human-AI collaboration 
                will be the norm.
              </p>
              <p>
                By offloading routine calculations and procedural tasks, AI enables students to engage with more sophisticated problems 
                and develop deeper mathematical and scientific intuition. Students can work on real-world applications rather than getting 
                bogged down in computational mechanics.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI can also facilitate collaborative learning by connecting students with similar interests or complementary skills, 
                fostering peer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange in ways that traditional classrooms may struggle to achieve.
