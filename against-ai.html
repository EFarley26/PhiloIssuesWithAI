            <p>
              One of the major issues of relying on AI for education is AI’s ability to create and then cite false information.
              This becomes increasingly dangerous when the user is unable to identify these hallucinations when they happen.
              As a result, users learn and rely upon false information hurting their education and future. AI's
              willingness and the frequency at which it hallucinates makes it an unreliable teacher that should not be trusted
              with the education of students.

          <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              An additional issue with integrating  AI in education is it poor teaching skills and habits. While AI has access
              to a vast array of information spread all across the internet, it has yet to learn a productive way to teach that
              to the user. This makes it prone to giving away the answer removing the need for students to think adn act independently.
              Referencing John Dewey’s educational philosophy,
              <a href="https://jamesmlang.substack.com/p/john-dewey-on-artificial-intelligence"
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                James M. Lang
              </a>
              argues in his article that it is through experience and reflection that students learn best, and that tools like AI shortcut
              experiences, harming student learning and limiting future growth. AI is not able to give students the needed
              experience to help them grow and develop new skills, as it allows students to bypass challenges rather than
              work through them. By showing answers instead of encouraging exploration, AI skips the learning process and
              becomes a poor teacher that ultimately harms students’ education.

      <!-- Cheating -->

          <h2 class="text-red-600">Cheating</h2>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              The largest issue education has faced as a result of AI has been the rampant increase of cheating largely
              due to how easy AI has made it. With the click of a button, models like ChatGPT or Gemini can complete
              worksheets, read articles, and write essays at a high quality. Students no longer need to think to complete
              their homework, but can instead rely on AI for everything teachers ask of them. Additionally, as Troy Jolliemore discusses in 
              <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/i-used-to-teach-students-now-i-catch-chatgpt-cheats"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I Used to Teach Students. Now I Catch ChatGPT Cheats
              </a> 
              this type of cheating not only harms students who fail to learn the material, but also disadvantages
              students who complete their work honestly. Teachers are forced to either assume AI use across the board or grade
              on trust alone, creating a lose-lose situation where academic integrity and fairness are undermined.

          <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              From a teaching perspective, AI limits the teacher’s ability to understand their students on a personal level.
              When AI completes student work or answers questions on their behalf, teachers lose insight into students’
              strengths and weaknesses. This removes critical feedback needed to adjust lessons or revisit difficult topics.
              As
              <a href="https://jamesmlang.substack.com/p/john-dewey-on-artificial-intelligence"
                 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                James M. Lang
              </a>
              explains, student work no longer reflects individual understanding when AI is involved, shifting the teacher’s
              role from educator to supervisor. Teachers are now forced to attempt to police AI use. This ultimately detracts
              from meaningful teaching and places instructors in an unwinnable position.
