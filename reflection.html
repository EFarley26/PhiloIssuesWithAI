            <p>
              Based on my personal use of AI over the last three years, it has quickly become a large part of my routine when completing work of all kinds. Large scale language models like ChatGPT found their way into most aspects of what I do on a day-to-day basis. This was most true over the summer during my first professional internship in downtown Chicago. Over the course of the summer, I found myself relying on AI for the mundane and professional tasks that I wanted to make sure I got right the first time. This included simple things like writing emails, checking my grammar, and keeping my to-do list up to date. I brought this back to school with me where ChatGPT has become my go to for homework questions, research, and exam preparation. I can ask my “dumb” questions and spend hours on singular topics that I wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity to explore without needing to bother others. This allows me to feel more confident come exam time and over the course of my college career has definitely helped me succeed in new areas. While I know there are other ways to accomplish these tasks, AI feels like it provides a simple and reliable way to complete these simplistic tasks quickly and effectively.

            <p>
              I firmly believe that while AI is an amazing tool that can accomplish a lot for its users, it is a slippery slope where it is hard to see where AI is turning from helpful to hurtful. Speaking with friends around school and from back home, I see the over-reliance on AI that cripples a person’s ability to independently make decisions, and I think this will only get worse as the more useful and reliable AI appears. I fear this the most in middle and high schools where the content is easily replicated by AI tools and students don’t have the foresight to what skills and knowledge is critical going forward. While helpful in rudimentary topics, AI knowledge quickly becomes limited in specialized or cutting-edge scenarios that will leave over reliant student struggling with no resources. Additionally, AI cannot help in countless areas like public speaking or individual interactions. Finally, I believe there is a large distinction between knowing a topic in your heading and knowing where to find the answer on the internet. I fear new students will develop an overreliance on AI and leave them without the fundamental skills to help them success outside of school.
